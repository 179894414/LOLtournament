Introduction:
The project is about League of Legends (LOL), a worldwide popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game. 
Riot Game, the company that develops LOL, holds official tournaments each year.
There are totally 12 divisions of leagues from 12 different countries worldwide. Among these 12 divisions, there are four major divisions, in which the competitive levels are the highest, as well as the degree of professionalism and the arrangements of tournaments are the most standardized and procedural. 

The four major divisions are:
LPL, China;
LCK, South Korea;
LCS, North America;
LEC, Europe.

There are four major seasons in each year:
Spring Season;
Mid-Season Invitational (MSI);
Summer Season;
World Championship.

Spring and summer season tournaments are hold domestically in each division;
MSI and World are international tournaments where eligible teams from each division gather together and compete each other to get the final world champion.
