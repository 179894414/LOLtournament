[["index.html", "LOL Tournament Data Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " LOL Tournament Data Analysis Tongni Chem, Tao Yu 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction In recent years, popularity of e-sports has dramatically increased all over the world. There are official tournaments hold for different games, and they have also gradually entered some mainstream large stages, such as the Asian Games. As fans and also players of video games, we would like to choose e-sports as topic for this project. The game we would like to investigate is League of Legends (LOL), a worldwide popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game. Riot Game, the company that develops LOL, holds official tournaments each year. Our project will investigate on data from these official tournaments. There are totally 12 divisions of leagues from 12 different countries worldwide. Among these 12 divisions, there are four major divisions, in which the competitive levels are the highest, as well as the degree of professionalism and the arrangements of tournaments are the most standardized and procedural. The four major divisions are: LPL, China; LCK, South Korea; LCS, North America; LEC, Europe. There are four major seasons in each year: Spring Season; Mid-Season Invitational (MSI); Summer Season; World Championship. Spring and summer season tournaments are hold domestically in each division; MSI and World are international tournaments where eligible teams from each division gather together and compete each other to get the final world champion. Our project will firstly focus on the relationship between different factors in the game, for example relationship between total kills and total gold, will higher total damage bring higher wining rate, etc.. After that, we will also compare and contrast the data from different seasons and from different four major divisions, for example, since we are fans of LPL division, we would like to see how LPL teams stat change over different seasons, or how KD (kill-to-death ratio) change in different divisions. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Introduction: The project is about League of Legends (LOL), a worldwide popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game. Riot Game, the company that develops LOL, holds official tournaments each year. There are totally 12 divisions of leagues from 12 different countries worldwide. Among these 12 divisions, there are four major divisions, in which the competitive levels are the highest, as well as the degree of professionalism and the arrangements of tournaments are the most standardized and procedural. The four major divisions are: LPL, China; LCK, South Korea; LCS, North America; LEC, Europe. There are four major seasons in each year: Spring Season; Mid-Season Invitational (MSI); Summer Season; World Championship. Spring and summer season tournaments are hold domestically in each division; MSI and World are international tournaments where eligible teams from each division gather together and compete each other to get the final world champion. Our project will focus on official tournaments data from the four major divisions in different seasons. Research topic: Research topic I: How does data of each team in LPL change across different seasons, for example, compare the winning rate, total kills, kill-to-death ratio, baron control rate, etc., of each team in different seasons. (Since we both are fans of LPL, so the first topic is focused on LPL.) Like all other sports, conditions of players have big impact on their performances. It’s common that one player has his best condition in one time period, while he doesn’t play that well in other time period. Therefore, this encourages us to compare the data across different time period. Besides conditions, each version update of LOL also play an important tole in tournament. For example, it’s possible that in one game version, conservative characters are prior than aggressive characters, and thus, performance of players, who have their own specialized characters, will be largely influenced by different updates. Since updates always happen through time, so competition data of different teams always varies with time. Research topic II: How does tournament data compare across different divisions in spring and summer seasons? As mentioned before, spring and summer seasons are hold domestically in each division. In this part, we will consider each division as a whole and compare data of different divisions in these two domestic season. Different divisions have their own preferred competition strategies and styles, for example, one division can be more conservative or aggressive than the others. Therefore, the preferred characters, total kills, game duration, etc., vary a lot across different division. This encourages us to compare and contrast data in different divisions. Research topic III: How does tournament data compare across different teams in World Championship 2022? Among four seasons, World Championship is the one which weighted most. Each team will need to win the ticket to World in their own divisions first. Therefore, total number of teams that can attend World are limited. We would like to focus on the 4 teams who finally come to semi-final to see how they are different from each other. 2.2 Data availability Data: We looked up various websites that provides LOL tournament data e.g. https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol. Most of them are not posted by Riot, the company that owns the game and tournament, as an official data source, we locked on 2 main websites as our sources for the project. They are https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki and https://lpl.qq.com/es/data/. The first is officially warranted as reliable community use (2022) resources and the second is an official website. lolwiki is owned by fandom and lpl data is owned by Tencent, which bought Riot company in 2015 and thus officially owns and runs the game. The data is processed either by fandom or Tencent, based on LDP (LOL Esports Data Portal) from unreadable first-of-kind data into readable data. Where raw-data here refers to 2500 GB of uncompressed data per game.(2022) Which indicates the difficulty of interpreting completely raw game data. The data is available from the two websites indicated above as pictures, charts, and strings. We will mainly read in the data from websites as .cvs files and read these cvs files in R. We will focus on using https://lpl.qq.com/es/data/ as this is run by the official company and we interests more on LPL teams (this website focuses on LPL game datas and also includes world championship data across years). So is we have any question, we can contact Tencent on the official website. LeagueWiki(Fandom) is also available from https://support.fandom.com/hc/en-us/requests/new. As mentioned above, some data are presented in forms of pictures which are not strings or numbers that are directly accessible by the machine, so we might need to omit some data or try to process pictures depending on their importance. LPL data are presented in Chinese as this is a Chinese website so we need to work on translating the data if needed.

The data of LPL related all comes from LPL official data webpage. There is no public official data webpage for statistics of tournaments from other divisions. From LOL esports offical’s statements: “Last year, we rolled out the LoL Esports Data Portal to Riot-run professional LoL Esports regions, debuting the private and secure scrim data feature. Now, the LDP also supports community use cases, such as Leaguepedia and Oracle’s Elixir, by providing scalable and sustainable access to data such as match history data, replays, and more…” Fandom Wiki and Oracle Exilar are officially warrented community use sites by LOL esports offical. 3.1 Sources 3.1.1 LPL We collected statistics for LPL from LPL offical data webpage. The website url is https://lpl.qq.com/es/data/. Url for 2022 spring stat: https://lpl.qq.com/esnew/data/rank.shtml?iGameId=167&amp;sGameType=1,5 Url for 2022 summer stat: https://lpl.qq.com/esnew/data/rank.shtml?iGameId=167&amp;sGameType=7,8,9 ….. There includes teams stat, players’ personal stat, champion stat for each season. 3.1.1.1 LPL team stat Firstly, We collected statistics for LPL teams’ performances from 2016 to 2022 game seasons. 3.1.1.2 LPL player stat Similarly, we collected LPL players stats for the most recent season, summer 2022. 3.1.1.3 LPL champion stat We collected champion statistics for LPL teams from 2013 to 2022 game seasons. 3.1.2 Other divisions 3.1.2.1 Player stats We collected Player stats for 4 major divisions from most recent season from Fandom Wiki. The url is (for example devision ‘ABC’):https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/ABC/2022_Season/Summer_Season/Player_Statistics 3.1.2.2 Champion stats We collected champion stats for 4 major divisions from most recent season from Fandom Wiki. The url is (for example devision ‘ABC’):https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/ABC/2022_Season/Summer_Season/Champion_Statistics 3.1.2.3 Faker (one famous player) stat We collected statistics for player “Faker” from Oracle Exilar. The website is: https://oracleselixir.com/player/Faker/statsByYear 3.1.2.4 Worlds This is a data set about how many teams from different divisions entering the World championships, and in which round, they were finally eliminated. There is no existed data set that summarize these information, so we manually enter the values since there are not that much data. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.1 LPL For all data collected from LPL website, prior to importing the data, we modified the csv files by translating Chinese into corresponding English terms. 3.2.1.1 LPL team For LPL team statistics, we will identify the time of statistics by adding a column indicating which season statistics the data reflects and finally combine it into a large table. 3.2.1.2 LPL champion Similar as LPL team. 3.2.1.3 LPL player For player stats, the provided KDA was rounded too much, so we will calculated KDA based on K,D,A, also KDA formats were strings by format ‘total(average)’ , we will extract total and convert to int. 3.2.2 Other divisions As we are reading from an html, the datawill contain extra information we do not need, so we will modify by slicing up the list and change column names, and add division name for both champion and player statistics. 3.2.2.1 Champion 3.2.2.2 Player 3.2.3 All dataset For all of datasets above, there are stats that have numerical meaning but appears to be in character data type. For example, wining rate in all datasets is character data type with form “xx.xx%”. As there are many columns in different datasets that has this property, and we will not necessarily use all of them, so we will convert those values into numerical values when needed. The following is an example of code for transformation: 3.3 Missing value analysis As its really hard to collect game statistics (these statistics are often summary of individual acts player performs over the game), some columns might miss values depends on the season if no one is there to collect those values, the following is the missing value charts for the data sets we eventually used to construct the graphs. 3.3.1 LPL team stat Notice that those most important columns, green zone, like wining rate, KD, have no missing values since these are decisive data of a game so for every seasons, they will be collected and computed. While for other columns, all rows in some specific seasons were not collected and computed at all. PPG was never collected in all seasons from 2016 to 2022. 3.3.2 LPL champion stat 3.3.3 Four major division champion statstics Similar as LPL team missing values, those most important columns like, PB% (pick and ban), W (wining), L (losing), have no missing values, while other columns have missing rows in some seasons. 3.3.4 Faker statistics Similar as LPL team and champions. 3.3.5 All player stat For all players’ data set from both LPL and other divisions, there is no missing values.

We are interested in the relationship between pairs of columns of data, for example, is there a positive relationship between total gold earned and win rates, does higher total kills lead to higher gold earned. To visualize such relationship between multidimensional continuous variables, we choose two types of graphs: parallel coordinates plots and PCA biplots. 4.1.1 LPL 2022 The following parallel coordinates plot is generated on 7 columns of data from LPL 2022 tournaments in uni-min-max scale as different columns have different magnitude of values. Here is what each column of data stands for: WPM: average ward placed per minute. winrate: winning rate KD: kill to death ratio BN: baron control rate JNG: average share of games’ total jungle. GSPD: average gold difference between this team and its opponent DRG: dragon control rate Terminologies will be introduced briefly in the following analysis part. Start from left to right: no clear relationship can be derived between WCPM and wining rate since many crosses between lines in this part. Ward is an prop in game: it can helps to light up parts of maps which the team cannot see before placing wards. Ward in LOL means vision and information, a team with more vision control has more information and is more likely to ambush or gank another team successfully. Many analysts think that how to wisely use ward, i.e, how to wisely control the vision, can positively impact on wining of this game largely, but from this data set, it cannot be proved. 2: there shows a generally positive relationship between winning rate and KD since few cross between lines in this part. This makes sense since intuitively, higher kill to death ratio, i.e, higher kills or lower deaths, should lead to wining of this game, or reversely, winner of this game generally have higher KD. there also shows a generally positive relationship between KD and BN. Baron is a very significant resource in games as it brings many buffs, while there only exists at most 1 baron at a time, so teams need to compete to get baron. Therefore, the positive relationship also makes sense since higher KD means this team can be more competitive in getting the baron, or reversely buffs from baron can bring this team higher KD. no clear relationship can be derived between BN and JNG. Also a generally positive relationship between JNG and GSPD. Jungle can also be considered as an important and competitive resources in games. More shares of jungle brings more gold, so more gold differences, or reversely, more gold differences generating from other resources, like baron,kills, means more competitive in getting more shares of jungle. Also a generally positive relationship between GSPD and DRG. Dragon is an another important and competitive resource in games. Thus, this positive relationship have similar reasoning as that of part 4. 4.1.2 LPL 2021 The above parallel coordinates plot is generated on the same 7 columns of data from LPL 2021 domestic tournaments. Most of relationship shows similar pattern as those from LPL 2022. But focus on the 1st part, the claim from analysts who think wards control have large impacts on wining rate can be a little bit more convincing in this data set since there shows a more positive relationship between WPM and wining rate compared to 2022 graph, but there are still a lot of crosses, so we cannot say that there is a positive relationship. To prove this claim, or to prove correlation between each pair of columns of data, we need many other advanced techniques. In these two parallel coordinates graphs, we can see some general relationship between two columns of data. 4.2 2 Relationship between columns of team performance data and similarity between teams We will draw PCA biplots using the same 7 columns of data. From biplots, we can further more investigating the relationship between columns of data by rotation vectors. In addition, we are also interested in the similarity between different teams, and biplots can also help us by clustering. 4.2.1 Loading vectors on relationship The above graphs are two PCA biplots using the same 7 columns of data from LPL 2022 and 2021. We first focus on th 6 columns except WPM. Notice that each pair of corresponding vectors to the rest 6 columns are forming a small angle, so it represents that each pair of them are positively correlated. From parallel coordinates (except WPM column), we also have described that there forms a generally positive relationship between adjacent pairs of columns, and synthesize with PCA, we can see more clearly that, except WPM, EACH pair of the rest 6 columns shows positive relationship between them. After that, from both graphs, we can notice that WPM meet other columns at angles close to 90°, so it represents that WPM are not very likely to be correlated with other columns, and this result is also consistent with what we found in parallel coordinates since there are many crosses between lines in WPH part. 4.2.2 Clustering graphs on similarity between teams Then, the above clustering graphs can help to investigate the similarity between teams. Compare two graphs, we can notice that few teams are clustered in the same group with the same other teams in both years. For example, in 2022, the Ultra Prime is single in one group , while in 2021, it is within the green group with 3 other teams. Therefore, it means that the similarity and difference between teams are not consistent, or even vary a lot in different time period. This makes senses with many possible reasons, for example: if this team is good at or bad at the different game versions in different years; one team can have very different players in different years, or although the players don’t change in one team in both years, players’ conditions vary a lot in different time period. These possible reasons impact teams’ performance a lot in different time period, thus the similarity between teams can vary a lot. 4.3 3 Change in LPL teams’ statistics over years Since from 2nd part, we know that teams performance can vary a lot in different time period. Therefore, we would like to further visualizing how their stat changes over years. For this part, we picked the 10 Teams with most games played over the 7 years from 2016 to 2022, and plotted time series graphs with respect to their win rate, Kill Death ratio and Ward/Minute. The first value, wining rate is definitely what we care a lot, and often a team will win if they kill more opponents than got killed. Ward, as we described before, could contribute a lot to winning. 4.3.1 Win rate We can see that the most famous teams (e.g. RNG,IG,EDG…) in general kept more than 50% winning over the years. RNG and EDG specifically has kept great winning rate over the years, that might explain why they had so many fans. We can also see for example IG and WE, though has periods of high winning rate, has lost their lead recently and this also was reflected on their popularity recently. Another interesting observation was OMG and JDG, though seems to lose quite a lot, still managed to play more games than many other teams. 4.3.2 KD Comparing this and the previous graph, we can see that indeed, teams with higher winning rate corresponds to teams with higher KD ration, which supports the assumption that KD is positively related to Winning rate. 4.3.3 Ward/minute From this graph, we have interesting observations, wards/min dropped for all teams from 2017 half to 2018 drastically, and also generally increased for all teams after 2018. These observations might indicate some important changes in vision/ward system in those game versions in those years since all changes were synchronous for all teams. 4.4 4 Change in teams’ statistics with respect to player position LOL is a team game where in each game, we have a 5-member squad. Different members in squad are in charge of different roles in LOL game. In this part, we aim to analyze how might different factors, i.e., different columns of data, affect win rate within different player role groups. For example, one might assume a support player, who in charge of vision control, would have a higher winrate if the support player has a higher vision score. This part intends to investigate if hypotheses like these holds or not. 4.4.1 KDA vs wining rate We first observe one of the most important factor of judging how a player is doing, his KDA ((kill+assist)/death). We can see indeed, players with higher KDA tends to have a higher winrate, these two variables are positively correlated. We can also see some patterns in player roles, it seems like with the same level of win rate, an ordering increasing KDA of player roles follows roughtly the pattern Top&lt;Sup=Jug&lt;Mid&lt;ADC. 4.4.2 DMG share vs wining rate This graph aims to investigate relationship between damage share and Winrate, unlike the previous graph, there does not seem be present a positive correlation between damage share and winrate, however we can see clearly a polarity in damage share with respect to player positions: Sup&lt;&lt;Jug&lt;&lt;Top&lt;Mid&lt;ADC 4.4.3 Players’ Gold share vs wining rate Similar to the above graph, there does not seem to be a strong correlation between GOLD share and Winrate. However we can discover the same trend as damage share, which might indecate a positive correlation between GOLD share and damage share. This makes sense as a player earning more gold would be more capable of causing more damage as they have better equipements. 4.4.4 Players’ ward score vs wining rate Again, we did not discover a strong correlation between Ward Score and winrate. We discovered again a trend in ward score: Top&lt;Mid&lt;ADC&lt;Jug&lt;&lt;Sup. 4.5 5 Pick and ban (BP) This part will focus on percentage of pick and ban of champions. Let’s first introduce what is pick and ban. Before entering the game, two teams will first pick and ban their champions, which we call BP part. Ban of a champion means that both two teams cannot pick this champion. One team can ban 5 champions, so in each game, 10 champions will be banned. After banning, two teams will pick 5 champions for their own. BP part plays an important role to the final lineup of the squad. BP part is mostly the responsibility of coach and his/her teams. Many analysts think that thelineup of the squad can be decisive to the victory of this game. Thus, we are also interested to investigate the BP part. 4.5.1 Scatter plot between wining rate and PB In the above plot, W stands for winning rate. PB stands for percentage of games in which the champion was either banned or picked. We have an intuition that a “stronger” or a more useful champion in one game version should be picked or banned more often, and “stronger” or more useful also can be more prone to lead to the victory of a game. Therefore, we guess that higher PB values should have a positive relationship between wining rate. The above plot use data of LPL tournaments from 2013 to 2022, 10 years of data. We can firstly notice that there is no clear positive relationship between PB and W, which contradicts our intuition. Instead, except those extreme values where W = 0 and 100, the rest values seem to form a normal distribution or uniform distribution. To check this, we can use heatmap to have a clearer visualization since there are large amount of dots. 4.5.2 Heatmap between wining rate and PB In the heatmap, we can see that the higher frequency occurs around wining rate = 50% as the lighter part occur there. And it becomes darker spreading out, i.e, the frequency decreases when spreading out. Therefore, we see no positive relationship between W and PM, and rather, it seems like a normal distribution with median W = 50%. We have a guess that the distribution of wining rate dominates the middle part of these two graphs. Therefore, let’s check the distribution of W by normal QQ plot. 4.5.3 Normal QQ plot on wining rate In the above normal QQ plot, we filter out those extreme values where W=0 and 100. Notice that we cannot conclude that wining rates form a normal distribution, while the trend is close to normal distribution. And this trend is also consistent with the trend in the scatter plot and the heatmap. Therefore, we cannot conclude any relationship between W and PB, since the approximate normal distribution trend can be the result of law of large numbers. 4.6 6 BP pattern across devisions Continuing with BP, this part aims to compare champion ban and pick patterns across regions. There tends to be stereotypes like:LEC and LCS devisions are capable of playing a more variaty of champions compared to LCK and LPL, this graph is to investigate if this holds or not. Based on the graph, we can see although the four regions holds similar patterns, LPL and LCK on the contarary has more rare picks and bans, which indicate that they either played or saw opponent teams played a champion that rarely appearing in the season. This is exactly the opposite of the stereotype we tried to investigate on which is interesting. 4.7 7 Players’ KDA statistics across region Similar like all other sports, there are world famous players in LOL e-sports who have large number of fans. Among all factors, what attracts audiences and fans a lot is the killing and death data, since it can represent the ability, or dominance, of players. If you don’t play games at all, you can consider KD as how many scores a basketball player get among this year. This part aims to investigate star players’ KDA statistics across region and see if there’s any trend. Unlike our initial assumption that KDA should not vary this much across region, there seems to be a clear order of top players’ KDAs across region: LPL is a lot higher than the other region. This can, in some extension, represent the style of LPL division: matches in LPL tournaments are often fierce, i.e., they prefer fights rather than operating. 4.8 8 Faker statistics Perhaps the most famous player in LOL tournaments is Faker, the legendary player since start of LOL tournaments. He wined the world championship for three times among 12, the player with the most championships. This graph illustrates how faker’s statistics changes over time. Faker won championship in 2013, 2015 and 2016. Therefore, notice that win rates are high in these three years. We can see that across these years, faker’s statistics has grown stable as well as a slow decrease, especially DMG%, perhaps due to his increasing age. Age is an especially important factor in Esports’ performance, as younger players has faster response speed and is more capable of intense matching environment for a longer period of time. Therefore, the graph is consistent with what we expect. 4.9 World championship In this part, we will investigate the performance of each divisions by visualizing how many teams from each division were qualified and finally entered the world championships, and at which round they were finally eliminated. This data set includes data from 2019 to 2022, the recent 3 world championships. The alluviums are colored by Class1, which is the division. class 1 represents how many teams from each division were qualified to enter World in these three years. Notice that China, Europe, Korea, North America have the most teams qualified, and these four divisions are four major divisions. Class 2 represents at which round the teams were eliminated. From top, final winner, to bottom, playin, we can clearly notice by color that most of green alluviums and orange alluviums gather in the top, which represent teams from China and Korea often had good performance as they often entered finals and semifinals. After green and orange, there gathers yellow and blue alluviums, which are Europe and NA. Therefore, four major divisions often had better results than other divisions, and among 4, China and Korea were more competitive in getting the final world champions. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 Analysis", " Chapter 5 Interactive component label { font-family: sans-serif; } svg { background: #eeeeee; } Bilibili Gaming Edward Gaming Invictus Gaming Royal Never Give Up Oh My God 5.1 Analysis The main idea of this interactive pis to let users choose which team’s stats they would like to see, hence enhancing visibility. As we can see there are multiple teams, and its easy to get confused with too much lines . So we decided to add a choice box, when the box is selected, user can see the team they wish to see. The drawback we still face is the color, we haven’t find the fitting color as the color scale is some what different between html and r, also we only included 5 teams’ lines, in the future we might hope to add more teams with better aestetic choices. Also we wish to add names to the lines to better enhance reading in the future. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion Our project investigate the relationship between different factors in the game, for example relationship between KD and wining rates. We also compare and contrast the data from different seasons and from different four major divisions. We successfully get some solid conclusions in our results, while there are also many limitations occur. Firstly, during our investigation on the relationship between different columns of data from games, we get some interesting visualization by applying parallel coordinates plots and PCA biplots on these multidimensional continuous variables, for example, we visualize some positive relationship between KD and wining rate. While the limits are that we can only stop at relationship, we definitely would like to prove some correlation between each pair of columns since this can be a much stronger conclusion. Therefore, our future direction will be to investigate the causal correlation between factors by other statistics techniques. Secondly, we know that wining rate is a considerably important column among all data. Besides to see the relationship between wining rate and other factors, it would be great if we can predict the final wining rate during the live game with some current data, like current gold difference between two teams. This again needs investigation on the correlation between wining rate and other factors, and in addition, we need some prediction and modeling techniques from machine learning field. Thirdly, in several parts of our project, we mention some popular claims, like wards contribute a lot to wining, lineup of the squard is decisive to victory. During our project, we try several methods to check if these claims hold. We cannot prove these claims by our techniques, while we cannot reject these claims either, because to investigate, for example, if wards is an influencing factor of wining rate, we need to control all other influencing factors of wining rate consistent. Therefore, in the future direction, we can use other techniques, such as propensity score matching, to prove or disprove these claims. Last but not least, during our compare and contrast of players’ data from different divisions, we also get some interesting results, for example, LPL players’ KDA is much higher than that of players from other divisions. In the future direction, we are also interested in, for example, given a player’s stat, can we predict which division is he from. To do this, we also need modeling techniques to find important and distinct features of players from different divisions.
